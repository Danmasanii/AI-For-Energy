        <h2>The Effect On The Climate</h2>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>
      It has been estimated that in 2019 around <b>36 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> were emitted.</b> 
      This is an increase of <b>44%</b> from the year 2000, when 25 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> were emitted. 
      Increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been linked to higher normal temperatures, more intense heat waves, melting ice that causes the sea to rise, change in climate where animals can live as well as seasonal displacement, ie, plants that bloom and wither earlier or later than the normally would have done.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li> Temperatures will rise</li>
        <li>Frost-free as well as growing seasons are getting longer</li>
        <li>More drought and more and longer heat waves</li>
        <li>Hurricanes will become more intense</li>
        <li> The sea level will have risen by 30 to 240 cm by 2100</li>
        <li>The Arctic Ocean (the Arctic Ocean) is very likely to become ice-free</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>What Can Be Done?</h2>
      <p>
      The effect of CO<sub>2</sub> can be counteracted by developing climate-friendly technologies. 
      By utilizing the energy the Earth and the Sun make available, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be reduced so much that disasters can be reduced or perhaps even begin to go the opposite way.
      </p>
      <p>
      Here, however, there are also things any individual can change in everyday life to change their own climate footprint. 
    This includes things like eating less red meat and replacing it with chicken. 
      Use less power during the day, 
       whether it is a lamp that goes out when it is not needed, or whether it is a flat screen TV when you leave home. The most important thing you can do, however, is to spread the message with credible and correct data, as well as to put a lot of focus on the catastrophic effects that will occur if CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are not reduced.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
      Creating awareness of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions among young people is critical as they are the future of our planet.
      That is why we have created this website, so that it can hopefully be shared among young people,
     so that important information can be disseminated about the world's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, as also mentioned earlier, 
     it can have catastrophic consequences for future generations. We will spread this website in the hope of seeing a difference in the future so that children and young people are not exposed to this. If you have read this, ask yourself the following, "Will I expose future children to my actions?"
      </p>
      <p>
      Hopefully this data will be useful to you, whether it is for school projects, demonstrations, 
      presentations or anything else.
